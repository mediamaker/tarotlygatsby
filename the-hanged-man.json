This tree is rooted deep down in the underworld, and it is known to support the heavens. He has a serene expression on his face, suggesting that he is there of his own free will. He is viewing the world with a different perspective. A halo around his head suggests enlightenment and insight. Although his right foot is bound to the tree, his left foot is free. He is wearing red pants symbolizing the human body and passion. This card represents the ultimate surrender and sacrifice for the greater good.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-hanged-man.md","sha":"dfa7dc2f9b67d9260453ae750a97e1fb76e71279"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/the-hanged-man.jpg","sha":"08ef80cb638bd56fdefdaf126c2036a297462229"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T13:39:10.202Z"}
