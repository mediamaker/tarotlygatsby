The Moon is a symbol of illumination and intuition, illuminating a path through the dark. The scene is balanced by the two columns standing guard at either side of her one labeled _B_ and the other _J_. The Priestess represents strong, feminine energy emphasizing balance  and duality. From masculinity and femininity, good and evil, light and dark - there is an instinctive understanding that neither can exist without the other.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-high-priestess.md","sha":"d2e095d56870cab20c9bb0ddf906026087c3c3e9"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-09T09:01:45.668Z"}
