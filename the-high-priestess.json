The Moon is a symbol of illumination and intuition, illuminating a path through the dark. The scene is balanced by the two columns standing guard at either side of her one labeled _B_ and the other _J_. The Priestess represents strong, feminine energy emphasizing balance  and duality. From masculinity and femininity, good and evil, light and dark - there is an instinctive understanding that neither can exist without the other.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-high-priestess.md","sha":"60cd66eba710d8bd1c7a2313fa9f0617c689d93f"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/the-high-priestess.jpg","sha":"2fe3a3efc91b928b98878199f8ed31884a61d69e"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-07T05:12:09.771Z"}
