The skeleton represents the part of the body which survives long after life has left it; the armor symbolizing invincibility and that death will come no matter what. Its dark color suggests mourning or mystery, while the horse's color is one of purity and strength. In the background, a boat floats down the river, similar to the mythological boats escorting the dead to the afterlife. The Death card suggests not just endings but beginnings and of inevitable change.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/death.md","sha":"1b3c0c2d3dfa8d09f17a99c029425eab03ae6218"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/death.jpg","sha":"119b7cf6984b73aa26cfa3ba5f6ab745746abdf6"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T13:44:43.540Z"}
