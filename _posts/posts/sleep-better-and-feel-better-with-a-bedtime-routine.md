Rejuvenate with deep sleep. This simple checklist will help you wind down before bed so you can feel truly restored in the morning

- [ ] Sit comfortably on a chair or on the floor.
- [ ] Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breathing, stay focused here for a few breaths. Notice your breaths become longer and deeper.
- [ ] Mentally review the day you just had from when you woke up in the morning through this moment right now, feel grateful for being on this planet for this day.
- [ ] Mentally anticipate waking up with the same sense of gratitude in the morning tomorrow, knowing you will feel excited to go out into the world and help other people.
- [ ] Smile and feel your eyes relax, your lips, feel that sensation work it's way down and throughout your whole body.
- [ ] Open your eyes. Drink a glass of water, and lie down in bed, relaxed and ready to effortlessly fall asleep
