description: >-
  The Devil is represented in his most well-known satyr form, half-goat and
  half-man. He has bat wings and on his forehead is an inverted pentagram. He is
  standing on a podium and chained to the podium are a nude man and woman. The
  man and woman are also horned, suggesting that the longer they are in the
  Devil's presence the more they become like him. The man and woman look
  unhappy, their power taken away from them leaving them exposed and ashamed.
meaning: >-
  The Devil card suggests you may be feeling trapped or enslaved by something or
  someone. You may be feeling powerless to change your circumstances. Are you
  feeling unable to control urges or impulses? Maybe you are not feeling in
  control of a situation. This card represents your darker side, or shadow self,
  the negative things holding you back, such as insecurities. Look at the
  negative influences in your life, shine a light on them so that you can free
  your self of them. Know that you have the strength and willpower to overcome
  anything.
reversedMeaning: >-

  poor habits. You are letting go of things that no longer serve you. Face your
  fears and anxieties head on, eliminating harmful influences and associations.
  This may not be an easy journey but will lead to a more joyful existence. Take
  this card as an opportunity to bring positive change into your life.
