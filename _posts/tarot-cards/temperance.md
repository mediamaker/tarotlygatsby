  The Temperance card shows an angel with wings, being both male and female. The
  angel balances with one foot on the rocks, illustrating the need to stay
  grounded, and one foot in the water, showing the need to be in flow. She holds
  a cup in each hand, pouring water between them. In the background, is a path
  leading up to a mountain symbolizing a journey to a higher understanding. The
  card represents finding balance and harmony in life.
meaning: >-
  The Temperance card is presented when you are experiencing stress or anxiety
  in your life as a reminder to remain calm. The card suggests the need for
  moderation and patience, avoiding extreme situations. You are reassured that
  you are embarking on a journey of higher learning. Perhaps where you have
  previously struggled to come to terms with something, you are now finding
  peace. This card encourages you to find a balance in your life, one with
  purpose and meaning.
reversedMeaning: >-
  When reversed, this card suggests that you are lacking balance in your life.
  The card may be a warning that you are taking a certain path that could lead
  to turbulence. Perhaps you are living in excess, spending excessingly or
  over-indulging. There may be a need to heal yourself. You may feel that life
  is not flowing at the moment, perhaps you are feeling stuck. There is a need
  to evaluate your life and purpose. Focus on what your long-term vision, what
  does it look like and how will you get there.
