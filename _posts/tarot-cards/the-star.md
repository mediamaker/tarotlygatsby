  The Star card shows a woman kneeling at the edge of a small pond. She is
  holding a container in each hand. One container is pouring water out onto the
  dry land, nourishing the land and the other container is pouring water into
  the small pond. The woman has one foot on the ground, representing her
  practical abilities, whilst the other foot is in the water, representing her
  intuition.There is a large central star surrounded by seven small stars which
  represent the chakras.

  When reversed, this card suggests that you may be feeling like the forces are
  against you. You may have lost faith in yourself or another. You may be
  feeling defeated or hopeless. If you are seeing something as a punishment,
  look to see if there are any life lessons to be learned. You may be feeling
  uninspired in your daily life, or that it is lacking creativity. Now is the
  time to reconnect into what makes you happy and fulfilled.
