  The Strength card shows a woman calmly holding the jaws of a lion. Even though
  the lion looks fierce, the lady calmly has control over the fierce animal. She
  represents being in control even when experiencing challenges or difficulties.
  The woman does not achieve control over the lion with force, but with
  compassion. The lion represents courage and survival.

  To draw this card means that you have courage even in times of trouble and
  distress. There may be a need for a calm approach to resolve a situation. You
  may need to face someone without fear, drawing on your inner courage. 


  This card can be a reminder to exercise patience in order for a situation to
  play out.
