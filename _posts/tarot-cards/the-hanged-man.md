  The Hanged Man card shows a man suspended upside-down, hanging by his foot
  from the living world tree. This tree is rooted deep down in the underworld,
  and it is known to support the heavens. He has a serene expression on his
  face, suggesting that he is there of his own free will. He is viewing the
  world with a different perspective. A halo around his head suggests
  enlightenment and insight. Although his right foot is bound to the tree, his
  left foot is free. He is wearing red pants symbolizing the human body and
  passion. This card represents the ultimate surrender and sacrifice for the
  greater good.
meaning: >-
  When this card is presented, it suggests the need to make a sacrifice in order
  for progression to be made. The upside-down perspective indicates the need to
  see things from a different perspective. Perhaps you are making a sacrifice
  that others do not understand, or it is you who does not understand the need
  for sacrifice. The Hanged Man card can convey the need to suspend an action or
  decision, taking time for reflection before moving forward. If a situation has
  naturally come to a halt or does not seem to be progressing, it is time to
  surrender to the pause rather than keep on pushing forward. Take this time to
  reflect.
reversedMeaning: >-
  When reversed, this card indicates you may be feeling that you are sacrificing
  a huge amount but not getting anything in return. You may be feeling
  frustrated at a situation but you are being encouraged to surrender rather
  than resist. You may have felt that your life has been paused, but this card
  suggests that a change in perspective will help you move forward. Maybe you
  have been stalling on making a decision, and this card reassures you that you
  can take a leap of faith.
