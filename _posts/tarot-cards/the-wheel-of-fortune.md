  The Wheel of Fortune is one of the most symbolic cards in the deck. The giant
  wheel in the center is inscribed with symbols. The letters TORA are seen in
  the circle, thought to be a version of the word Torah, meaning ‘law’, or even
  ROTA (Latin for ‘wheel’). 


  The middle wheel has the alchemical symbols for mercury, sulphur, water and
  salt – the building blocks of life and the four elements, representing
  formative power. Around the outer circle is a snake, representing the life
  force plunging into the material world. Anubis, the Egyptian God of the dead
  who welcomes souls to the underworld, also sits on the outer circle. 


  On top of the wheel sits the Sphinx, representing knowledge and strength. In
  the corners of the card are four winged creatures, each associated with the
  four fixed signs of the Zodiac.
meaning: >-
  The Wheel of Fortune indicates constant cycles and change. There may be times
  when you are at the top of the wheel, and other times, you will be at the
  bottom. It encourages us all to accept that there will always be good and bad
  times, but it is the journey that counts. This card is also often referred to
  as the Wheel of Karma, with 'what goes around comes around' and the idea that
  what you give out in life will be reflected back into your life. 


  The card encourages you to be optimistic and have faith in the Universe. There
  may be factors out of your control right now, but this is a reminder for you
  to go with the flow.
reversedMeaning: >-
  The reversed Wheel of Fortune represents the idea that luck may not be on your
  side right now. You may feel that the Universe is against you. This is an
  opportunity to let go of things holding you back and to look at the lessons
  that must be learned in order to move forward. 


  This card can suggest the need to move on, perhaps you are feeling stuck,
  stunted or holding back.
