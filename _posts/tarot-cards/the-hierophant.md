  The Hierophant card depicts a religious figure sitting in a place of worship.
  His right hand is properly raised in an act of benediction, a sign of
  blessing. In his other hand, he carries a triple cross, associated
  traditionally with the Pope. Beneath him, two acolytes are seated,
  representing the transfer of sacred knowledge and education.
meaning: >-
  The Hierophant card symbolizes the need to take a traditional, conformist
  approach to a situation. To go with the system, rather than against it. This
  card shows that you need to conform to the already existing set of rules and
  situations. This can be applicable to your relationship with religion or
  spirituality, but also has a broader meaning of organizations and
  establishments in general.
reversedMeaning: >-
  The Hierophant card reversed indicates that you may be feeling restricted and
  constrained from too many structures and rules. You may wish to challenge or
  question traditions. Perhaps you feel like you need to break free from a
  restraint. Look at what belief systems are serving you and which are hindering
  you.
