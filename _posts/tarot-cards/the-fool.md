description: >-
  The Fool embarks on an adventure, wide-eyed to the world and full of carefree
  innocence. The personification of absolute potential, The Fool steps off a
  cliff, about to lurch headlong into whatever awaits below. Whether disaster
  lies ahead or great rewards await, The Fool departs on a grand adventure,
  ready for new experiences and to begin their journey.
meaning: >-
  The Fool represents not only the beginning of a new adventure or a new chapter
  but also the need to take a leap of faith. The dog at the Fool's side suggests
  faithfulness, the need to have faith in our journey. The dog can suggest that
  your journey will be accompanied by a companion, but more often can mean a
  spirit guide. We are reminded that we are never truly alone. The dog is also a
  symbol of protection. The Fool card reminds us that it's never too late to
  follow your dreams on a journey or adventure, whether you can see what lies
  ahead or you or not.
reversedMeaning: >-
  The reversed Fool suggests the big change you are considering may not have the
  outcome you are expecting. Ensure you've taken time to turn over all the
  details. Take a deep breath and ask yourself if it's still the right decision
  for you. You may feel reluctant to take that leap of faith. Make sure you
  consider all your options. On the other hand, this card reversed can indicate
  that you are acting recklessly and are jumping into situations without fully
  considering the consequences. It is possible to live in the moment without
  putting yourself and others at risk.
