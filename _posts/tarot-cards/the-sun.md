  is a card of optimism and joy. A sun shines brightly in the sky, casting its
  rays outwards. A child is playing in the foreground symbolizing innocence and
  inhibition. The child is riding a white horse, indicating strength, nobility
  and purity.

  way to achieving your goals. You may feel energised and enthusiastic about
  your future. Now is the time to express yourself authentically and without
  fear. Enjoy being you.

  When reversed, the Sun card indicates that you may be experiencing
  difficulties finding positives in your life at the moment. You may be feeling
  that there are clouds blocking the sun rays from reaching you. Are you feeling
  low in confidence or lacking enthusiasm? You need to find your inner child
  again, play and be silly. This card encourages you to forget about your
  worries and concerns, have fun. The card can also suggest that you are being
  unrealistic with situations, perhaps you are being overly optimistic.It could
  be time to reassess a situation and look at whether you are being realistic or
  overly confident.
