description: >-
  An elderly man stands alone at the peak of the mountain, holding a lantern in
  one of his hands and a staff on the other. The man is slow but sure in his
  approach, taking things a step at a time in order to reach his destination.
  The peak of the mountain symbolizes his accomplishment or success.
meaning: >-
  The Hermit card suggests a need to go within and gain an understanding of
  yourself. The Hermit walks in solitude and silence, with only the stars to
  guide him. 


  You may be feeling a need to disconnect from life, a need for simplicity and
  declutter. Perhaps you do not feel like you get enough time to contemplate
  away from modern day distractions. Are you being your true self? Are you being
  authentic with how you are living your life? You could be searching for
  guidance on a situation and need to work out what your next steps might be.
reversedMeaning: >-
  When reversed, the Hermit card suggests you may be isolating yourself away
  from others. You may feel trapped in your own little world and this card is
  encouraging you to immerse yourself in the world more. 


  You may feel that you are not making meaningful connections with people. Just
  as the wanderer sets out to find the truth about himself and who he is, there
  may be a need for you to search for a truth. If there is something that has
  been troubling you, now is the time to ask questions.
