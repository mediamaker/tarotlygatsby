  A stoic ruler figure, the Emperor, can be seen sat on a throne. In one hand he
  is holding a scepter representing his reign, and in the other hand is an orb,
  a symbol of the kingdom he rules over. Behind the throne, the barren mountains
  are rigid and strong relating to the grit and strength with which the Emperor
  rules.
