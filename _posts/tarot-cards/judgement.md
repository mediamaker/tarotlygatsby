  The Judgement card shows women, men, and children who are rising from the
  grave to respond to Angel Gabrielâ€™s trumpet call. Their arms are outstretched
  ready to receive their judgement. They are to meet their creator and find out
  where they will spend the remainder of eternity, in heaven or hell. A large
  mountain range in the background signifies the insurmountable obstacles and
  the impossibility of avoiding judgement.
meaning: >-
  The Judgement card suggests the need for self-reflection, looking inwards to
  assess our actions. There is a need to gain a clearer understanding of
  ourselves in order to grow. This card reminds us of the seriousness our
  actions can have and the inevitable consequences. If you have made mistakes in
  the past, it is time to let go of them so that you can move forward. Let go of
  any feeling of guilt and regret. Make time to evaluate what you have learned
  to avoid making the same mistake again.
reversedMeaning: >-
  The Judgement card reversed means that a time for reflection and assessment is
  needed. Maybe you feel like you are being judged by someone or that you are
  judging yourself harshly. You may need to overcome your own inner critic.
  Listen when you hear your inner critic, becoming aware of it so that you can
  start to replace it with words of affirmation and positivity. Now is the time
  to practice self-forgiveness and self-acceptance.
