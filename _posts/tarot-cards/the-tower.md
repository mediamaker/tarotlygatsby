  A tower is nestled on top of the mountain in this card. The tower is a solid
  structure but built on unstable foundations. A lightning bolt is seen striking
  the tower setting it on fire. People are jumping out of the windows in
  desperation. The Tower card illustrates ambitions and goals made on false
  premises.

  and beliefs to make way for new ones. This is a chance to look at the damage
  control in your life, with finances, career and relationships. Whatever cracks
