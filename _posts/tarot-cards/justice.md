  The Justice card represents the symbol of truth, fairness, and law. The woman
  sits in her chair holding scales in her left hand symbolizing balance and
  logic. In her other hand, she holds a double-edged sword suggesting
  impartiality. She stands between two pillars representing structure and
  balance. A white shoe pokes out from underneath her cloak, with spiritual
  connotations. This is a reminder of the spiritual consequences of our actions,
  as well as those associated with the law.

  This card is a reminder that the decisions we make now have long-term
  consequences for ourselves as well as others. There may be a time when a
  decision you have made will be judged, but this card suggests that we will be
  judged fairly. If you feel you have been wronged by someone, this card may
  come as a relief that those who have wronged you will be judged for their
  actions. However, if you feel you have wronged another, then this card is
  encouraging you to account for your actions. The Justice card also reminds us
  that the truth will always prevail. This card implores you to seek out the
  truth in a situation.
