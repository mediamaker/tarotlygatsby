description: >-
  A full moon is seen in the night's sky with two towers either side. The moon
  represents intuition and the unconscious. In the foreground stand a wolf and a
  dog, one being wild while the other is civilized. Separating the animals is a
  path that runs all the way through to the towers in the distance. There is a
  duality in the card representing our conscious and unconscious.
meaning: >-
  The Moon card represents your fears from past experiences which may be
  resurfacing in the present, either consciously or subconsciously. You need to
  let go of the fears that are holding you back. The Moon can suggest a time of
  uncertainty for you, so it is important to listen to your intuition. What are
  you being guided to do? The Moon can also indicate a hidden truth that needs
  discovering. Look for what hidden forces are at play now.
reversedMeaning: >-
  The Moon card reversed suggests that you are aware of your fears and 
  anxieties and that you are working to free yourself from them. Do not try to
  hide these feelings deeper in your subconscious but rather bring them to the
  surface to deal with them. You may be going through a particularly intuitive
  time at the moment. Trust in what you know and feel, and listen to your inner
  guidance for the things you don't.
