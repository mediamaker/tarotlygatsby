description: >-
  The Magician stands confidently with one hand pointed towards the sky and the
  other pointed to the ground, symbolizing the heavens and the earth. Here the
  Magician has the ability to go between the two worlds. The four elements,
  being earth, water, air, and fire, are placed on the table in front of him.
  The Magician is harnessing the elements to create, with the symbol of infinity
  indicating the endless possibilities open to us.
meaning: >-
  The Magician invites us all to make use of what is around us, to be
  resourceful, in order to conjure and create. This card is a reminder of the
  infinite potential we all have, and how we are all capable of tapping into
  that potential. We are all powerful and have the ability to create great
  things as long as our intentions are set on it.
reversedMeaning: >-
  When reversed, this card indicates that you may not be reaching your true
  potential. You may need to make changes in your life in order to come into
  your own power. The card reversed can also mean illusion. Perhaps you are not
  living an authentic life and are creating an illusion of who you really are.
  The Magician also symbolizes deception and manipulation. Are you encountering
  a situation where you feel deceived or are not getting all the facts?
