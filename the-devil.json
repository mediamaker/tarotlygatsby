He has bat wings and on his forehead is an inverted pentagram. He is standing on a podium and chained to the podium are a nude man and woman. The man and woman are also horned, suggesting that the longer they are in the Devil's presence the more they become like him. The man and woman look unhappy, their power taken away from them leaving them exposed and ashamed.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-devil.md","sha":"94c22ad8a34c1568a60b3bd7073be5825d4249a7"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/the-devil.jpg","sha":"9c12a6f59738dba2a5795fb88cffdc6fcc1c1e3d"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T13:51:35.259Z"}
