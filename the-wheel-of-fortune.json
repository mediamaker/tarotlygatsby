The giant wheel in the center is inscribed with symbols. The letters TORA are seen in the circle, thought to be a version of the word Torah, meaning ‘law’, or even ROTA (Latin for ‘wheel’). \n\nThe middle wheel has the alchemical symbols for mercury, sulphur, water and salt – the building blocks of life and the four elements, representing formative power. Around the outer circle is a snake, representing the life force plunging into the material world. Anubis, the Egyptian God of the dead who welcomes souls to the underworld, also sits on the outer circle. \n\nOn top of the wheel sits the Sphinx, representing knowledge and strength. In the corners of the card are four winged creatures, each associated with the four fixed signs of the Zodiac.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-wheel-of-fortune.md","sha":"11658076d7052efef07bbb0cb32c57f42dc94e25"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/the-wheel-of-fortune.jpg","sha":"0da11a94077fe934ed34d3a84e1f6c2d0b7c5eeb"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T12:34:04.828Z"}
