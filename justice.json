The woman sits in her chair holding scales in her left hand symbolizing balance and logic. In her other hand, she holds a double-edged sword suggesting impartiality. She stands between two pillars representing structure and balance. A white shoe pokes out from underneath her cloak, with spiritual connotations. This is a reminder of the spiritual consequences of our actions, as well as those associated with the law.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/justice.md","sha":"58e02fc90f5f39b9cb46f00a29da33719230a784"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/justice.jpg","sha":"81c4f31ddcca141658c55b47e27fabc64987599d"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T13:31:10.163Z"}
