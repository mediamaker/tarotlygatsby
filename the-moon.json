The moon represents intuition and the unconscious. In the foreground stand a wolf and a dog, one being wild while the other is civilized. Separating the animals is a path that runs all the way through to the towers in the distance. There is a duality in the card representing our conscious and unconscious.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"_posts/tarot-cards/the-moon.md","sha":"5c115eef4aef3220882f299442b21a49b32ffaf3"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/uploads/the-moon.jpg","sha":"9ed4705ab3fbcccae065c02b7d1b718b4fdf8d03"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T19:54:37.716Z"}
